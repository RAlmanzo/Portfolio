                <p>
                    This website is my personal portfolio, where I introduce myself, showcase my skills, 
                    and provide an overview of my projects. Visitors can contact me through the site and view my code on GitHub. 
                    I designed and built this website entirely by myself, with a focus on responsive design and user-friendliness. 
                    Itâ€™s a living project that I continuously improve as my experience and knowledge grow.

                <p>
                    As a school project, I developed a web application that allows a reporter to provide live coverage of a kayak 
                    competition. Users can register for a race in advance and follow the event live through the app. 
                    The application was built with a focus on real-time interaction, user-friendly design, 
                    and registration functionality. This project taught me how to build a dynamic, 
                    component-based single-page web environment with multiple user roles (reporter and audience).
